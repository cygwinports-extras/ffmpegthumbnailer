sdesc: "Video thumbnailer to be used by file managers (library)"
ldesc: "This video thumbnailer can be used to create thumbnails for your 
video files. The thumbnailer uses ffmpeg to decode frames from the video 
files, so supported videoformats depend on the configuration flags of 
ffmpeg. This thumbnailer was designed to be as fast and lightweight as 
possible. The only dependencies are ffmpeg, libpng and libjpeg."
